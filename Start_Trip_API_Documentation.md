        "Verify card is still valid",

    ]
}
```

## Business Logic

### Payment Processing
1. **Visa/Wallet Payments**: Automatically charges the remaining amount using the selected saved card
2. **Cash Payments**: Marks payment as pending for cash collection at trip end
3. **Real Payment Gateway**: Uses actual payment processing (not dummy)

### Trip Status Flow
1. **Confirmed** â†’ **Ongoing** (after successful payment)
2. **Payment Status**: Updated based on payment method and success
3. **Log Entry**: Creates detailed log entry
4. **Notification**: Sends notification to renter

### Automatic Actions
- Updates rental status to `Ongoing`
- Processes payment using selected card
- Creates detailed log entry
- Sends notification to renter
- Records transaction details

## Usage Example

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8000/api/rentals/14/start_trip/ \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### JavaScript/Fetch
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/rentals/14/start_trip/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log('Trip started:', data);
```

## Related Endpoints

### Prerequisites
- `POST /api/rentals/{id}/owner_confirm_arrival/` - Driver confirms arrival
- `POST /api/rentals/{id}/renter_on_way/` - Renter announces they are on the way

### Next Steps
- `POST /api/rentals/{id}/stop_arrival/` - Confirm arrival at stops
- `POST /api/rentals/{id}/end_waiting/` - End waiting at stops
- `POST /api/rentals/{id}/end_trip/` - End the trip

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create rental and confirm booking
- [ ] Pay deposit (status becomes `Confirmed`)
- [ ] Driver confirms arrival (`owner_confirm_arrival`)
- [ ] Renter announces on the way (`renter_on_way`)
- [ ] Start trip - should succeed with payment processing
- [ ] Verify payment was charged to selected card
- [ ] Check notification was sent to renter
- [ ] Verify rental status changed to `Ongoing`

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
1. **No Selected Card**: For visa/wallet rentals without a selected card
2. **Payment Failure**: When card payment fails (insufficient funds, expired card, etc.)
3. **Missing Prerequisites**: When owner hasn't confirmed arrival or renter hasn't announced on the way
4. **Invalid Status**: When rental is not in the correct status for starting trip

### Recovery Actions
- For payment failures: Check card details and try again
- For missing prerequisites: Complete required steps first
- For invalid status: Follow the workflow in the correct order
